### About

This React App was created by Vishnu Ranganath in November 2021 as a submission
for the challenge required for paricipation in Capital One's Software
Engineering Summit. This project utilizes `react.js` and `react-bootstrap`.

This React App uses the U.S. National Parks Service's API to gather data about
various parks. It displays all parks that feature certain user-specified
activities, as well as information about any particular park, including
information about webcams provided by the NPS.

This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by the National Parks Service.
